# [letters.js](https://rack.pub/letters)
## Synopsis

JavaScript to increment letters of the alphabet.  Basically it increments letters like the column ID's of an Excel spreadsheet, e.g., submitting `A` returns `B` and `Z` returns `AA`.

## Code Example

A working example of the code is available at [https://rack.pub/letters](https://rack.pub/letters).

## Motivation

I needed to increment letters with JavaScript and found that a custom solution was required so I created it and wanted to share it.

## Installation
